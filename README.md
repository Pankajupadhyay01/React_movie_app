<h1 align="center" id="title">React Movie Review App</h1>

<p>The project uses the TMDB API to retrieve movie data and displays it in an attractive and easy-to-use interface. The front-end of the application is developed using React and Tailwind CSS, which provides a modern and responsive design. The Axios library is used to fetch data from the TMDB API, ensuring fast and reliable data retrieval.
  
The project has three main pages: the Home page, the Trending page, and the Search page. The Home page displays a selection of popular movies, while the Trending page shows movies that are currently trending. The Search page allows users to search for movies by title.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
